# Rocket-Project
I am working on a project for a rocket team competition.

We will have a raspberry pi Zero that will need to control a 
pi camera and a motor (I am using an H-bridge).
This code is the "EVC-code.py"
The pi will have to move the motor for a set time/rotations 
and then take a video while it does one additional rotation to create a 360 video.

We will also have a raspberry pi 3B+ that will control 3 sensors: 
Adafruit MPRLS, Adafruit MPL3115A2 and Hiletgo MPU9250/6500.
There will also be a Pi Camera attached as well. It will have to send live
telemetry and footage to a computer/ monitor during the rocket flight.
